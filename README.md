## _Description_

`Color Pick` is a color guessing game where the player picks colors based on their intuition and RGB guessing skills.

## _How To Play_

-   A color is given in the form of a RGB code in the instruction part of the page.
-   The player is supposed to guess the color and click the squares with colors.
-   If the wrong color is chosen, the square disappears. The player can continue playing until the correct square is chosen.
-   The player can click the `Change Colors` button if they wish to get a new set of colors. This will also generate a new color to guess.

## _Modes Of Gameplay_

1. `Easy Mode` : The player needs to guess from 3 squares.
2. `Hard Mode` : The player needs to guess from 6 squares.

## _How It Works_

1. A set of 6 colors are generated with a random number generator.
2. A color is chosen out of the 6 again with the help of the random number generator. This color is saved as the `Chosen Color`.
3. The squares are filled with the generated colors and the `Color Hint` is changed to show the `Chosen Color`.
